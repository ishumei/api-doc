# Tianxiang Risk Identification

## Invocation Timing

Invoke this interface when risk identification is needed, for example:

1. After new user registration, perform a risk profile query for differentiated distribution of newcomer red packets, registration gifts, etc.;
2. After existing users log in, perform a risk profile query for differentiated distribution in daily activity operations;
3. Before issuing activity rewards, perform a risk profile query, such as for random red packets, lottery draws, etc.;
4. Daily routine queries to update the profile database or risk control engine data.
